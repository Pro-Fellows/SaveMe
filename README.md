## Problem Domain

blood donation is not a culture in our tribal society , Jordan doesn't have the culture for anonymous blood donations, we are generous, helpful but probably helping those who we know, neighbors, friends of friends, family members, we want this culture to become a norm.
Jordan is and has been  hosting  a lot of refugees along the years, our society is getting mixed , people can be strangers in the same building or neighborhood , place also in mind the medical tourism in jordan, and the great medical sector that hospitalize a lot of patients and especially cancer patients who are number one blood donation recipients of blood transfusion in every country.
We need this anonymous blood donations that can help save lives.
Our main goal to our website is to advocate for this culture, promote for a better society, through the big picture to pass on any type of kindness.

**Pay Iit Forward!**
Donate, help, and you will always get a hand of help no matter where you are.
