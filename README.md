## Problem Domain

blood donation is not a culture in our tribal society , Jordan doesnt have the culutre for anonymous blood donations, we are generous, helpful but propably helping those who we know, niegbours, freinds of friends, family members, we want this culutre to become a norm.
Jordan is and has been  hosting  alot of refugees along the years, our society is getting mixed , people can be strangers in the same building or niegbourhood , place also in mind the medical tourism in jordan, and the great medical sector that hositalize alot of patients and especially cancer patients who are number one blood donation reciptients of blood transfucion in every country.
We need this anonymous blood donations that can help save lives.
Our main goal to our website is to advocate for this culture, promote for a better society, through the big picture to pass on any type of kindness.
