                     <summary>Is it safe to give blood? </summary>
                         <p class="text">Yes. Donating blood is safe. The supplies used to collect blood are sterile and only used once.</p>    
                 </details>

                 <details>
                    <summary>Are there age limits for blood donors? </summary>
                        <p class="text">Giving blood is one of the exciting things you can do when you turn 18. When you give blood, you give a bit of iron too, which is important when you’re still growing. </p>    
                </details>

                <details>
                    <summary>I'm taking medications. Can I still donate blood?</summary>
                        <p class="text">Many medications are acceptable. Consult your physician to be sure you're healthy enough to donate and ask your community blood center medical staff if you have questions about your eligibility. Do not assume that you are ineligible without inquiring first.</p>    
                </details>

                <details>
                    <summary>Will travel abroad make me ineligible to donate?</summary>
                        <p class="text">Travel to certain countries may prevent you from donating blood.</p>    
                </details>

                <details>
                    <summary>Will recent vaccinations make me ineligible to donate blood?</summary>
                        <p class="text">Recent vaccinations may prevent you from donating blood. Flu vaccines do no make you ineligible. Contact your blood center to request further information.</p>    
                </details>

                <details>
                    <summary>How long until my blood is used?</summary>
                        <p class="text">All blood donations are processed and available for use between 24 and 48 hours after collection. 
                            <ol>
                                <li>Whole blood is processed into components (red cells, platelets, plasma).</li>
                            <li>After processing, the red cells can be stored for up to 42 days.</li>
                            <li> Plasma can be frozen and stored for up to 12 months.</li>
                            <li>Platelets (from whole blood or by apheresis) must be used within five days.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </p>    
                </details>

                <details>
                    <summary>How long does it take to give blood?</summary>
                        <p class="text">The process for whole blood donation usually takes about one hour with the collection itself usually lasting only about 10 minutes. Expect to spend about two hours for an apheresis platelet collection. The donation process includes registration, a brief medical screening, blood collection, and refreshments.</p>    
                </details>

                <details>
                    <summary>How much blood do I have in my body?</summary>
                        <p class="text">Women have about 5 liters, and men about 6 liters of blood in their bodies.</p>    
                </details>

                <details>
                    <summary>What are red cells, platelets and plasma?</summary>
                        <p class="text">Red Cells - these give your blood its red color and carry oxygen to your organs and tissues.

                            Platelets - the very small colorless cell fragments in your blood whose main function is to stop bleeding.
                            
                            Plasma - the liquid portion of your blood that transports water and nutrients to your body's tissues.</p>    
                </details>

                <details>
                    <summary>How often can I give blood? </summary>
                        <p class="text">You can donate whole blood every 56 days. Red blood cells will return to normal levels within approximately two weeks of donation.

                            You can donate platelets (apheresis donation) as much as twice in a 7- day period - or up to 24 times in a rolling 12 months. Platelet and plasma components are replaced in the body more quickly than red cells. Platelets will return to normal levels within a few hours of donating. Plasma, the liquid portion of your blood, takes a couple of days.</p>    
                </details>

                <details>
                    <summary>Is it safe to receive blood?</summary>
                        <p class="text">The blood supply is safe. Blood donor eligibility standards, individual donor screening, laboratory testing, and donor record checks are in place at donor centers to help ensure the safety of blood transfusions.</p>    
                </details>

                <details>
                    <summary>What is the universal blood type?</summary>
                        <p class="text">Type O negative is the universal donor and can give blood to any other blood type. 
                            AB positive is the universal recipient and can receive blood from any other blood type.</p>    
                </details>

                <details>
                    <summary>I had several alcoholic drinks before going to give blood. Can I donate?</summary>
                        <p class="text">No. We do not take blood from anyone under the influence of alcohol. This is because being intoxicated can affect your ability to understand and answer the donor questionnaire and declaration. It also affects your body’s ability to tolerate blood being taken.</p>    
                </details>

                <details>
                    <summary>Cancer – I have had cancer. Can I donate?</summary>
                        <p class="text">In most cases you can donate again if you remain free of cancer five years after completing  treatment.</p>    
                </details>

                <details>
                    <summary>Breastfeeding - I am breastfeeding. Can I donate?</summary>
                        <p class="text"> For your health, following childbirth you need to wait at least nine months and until your baby is significantly weaned (that is, getting most of his/her nutrition from solids) before you donate blood.</p>    
                </details>

                <details>
                    <summary> Childbirth – How long after the birth of my baby can I donate?</summary>
                        <p class="text"> At least nine months, or longer if the baby is still breast-feeding significantly at nine months.</p>    
                </details>
